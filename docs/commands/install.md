Install
===============================================================================

Pre-reqs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 1. IBM Entitlement key
Access [Container Software Library](https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary) using your IBMId to obtain your entitlement key.

### 2. MAS License File
Access [IBM License Key Center](https://licensing.subscribenet.com/control/ibmr/login), on the **Get Keys** menu select **IBM AppPoint Suites**.  Select `IBM MAXIMO APPLICATION SUITE AppPOINT LIC` and on the next page fill in the information as below:

| Field            | Content                                           |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Number of Keys   | How many AppPoints to assign to the license file  |
| Host ID Type     | Set to **Ethernet Address**                       |
| Host ID          | Enter any 12 digit hexadecimal string             |
| Hostname         | Set to the hostname of your OCP instance          |
| Port             | Set to **27000**                                  |


The other values can be left at their defaults.  Finally, click **Generate** and download the license file to your home directory as `entitlement.lic`.

!!! note
    For more information about how to access the IBM License Key Center review the [getting started documentation](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/system/files/inline-files/GettingStartedEnglish_2020.pdf) available from the IBM support website.


Usage
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The install is an interactive command.  At present there is no support for an
unattended install, but this is planned for the future.

```bash
docker pull quay.io/ibmmas/cli
docker run -ti --rm -v ~:/home/local quay.io/ibmmas/cli
mas install
```

!!! important
    We will need the `entitlement.lic` file to perform the installation which is why we mount your home directory into the container.  If you saved the entitlement file elsewhere, mount that directory instead.

    When prompted you will be able to set license file to `/home/local/entitlement.lic`


Air Gap Support
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have already ran `mas configure-airgap` to install the ImageContentSourcePolicy for IBM Maximo Application Suite then the installer will automatically detect the presence of this and tailor the installation configuration for a disconnected installation.

A number of applications are not currently available when using a private mirror registry in this fashion, as a result you will not be asked whether you wish to install these applications:

- Maximo Assist
- Maximo Health & Predict Utilities
- Maximo Monitor
- Maximo Predict
- Maximo Safety
- Maximo Visual Inspection


SNO Support
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you  already ran `mas install` to install the  IBM Maximo Application Suite then the installer will automatically detect the presence of SNO and tailor the installation configuration for a connected installation.

A number of applications are not currently available when using a private mirror registry in this fashion, as a result you will not be asked whether you wish to install these applications:

- Maximo Assist
- Maximo Health & Predict Utilities
- Maximo Monitor
- Maximo Predict
- Maximo Safety
- Maximo Visual Inspection


Must Gather
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The pipeline sets a "finally" block that is executed at the end of the steps regardless of success or failure. Inside this finally block the **mustgather** Task is executed which runs the IBM AI Applications' Must Gather tool against a MAS instance. It uses the mustgather workspace to persist the output into a Persistent Volume for retrieval after the pipeline has completed.

Users can then use the **ibm.mas_devops.suite_mustgather_download** playbook locally to pull the mustgather output from the persistent volume.

!!! note
    The **mustgather** Task will clear any previous content found in the `/workspace/mustgather` persistent volume before each call to the mustgather playbook. This is to ensure that the persistent volume does not become full after multiple runs using the same persistent volume/namespace.


More Information
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The install is designed to work on any OCP cluster, but has been specifically tested in these environments:

- IBMCloud ROKS
- Microsoft Azure
- AWS ROSA
- IBM DevIT FYRE (internal)

### The Automation Engine
The engine that performs all tasks is written in Ansible, you can directly use the same automation outside of this CLI if you wish.  The code is open source and available in [ibm-mas/ansible-devops](https://github.com/ibm-mas/ansible-devops), the collection is also available to install directly from Ansible Galaxy:

- [Ansible Galaxy: ibm.mas_devops](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ibm/mas_devops)

### The Automation Driver
The install is performed inside your RedHat OpenShift cluster utilizing [Openshift Pipelines](https://cloud.redhat.com/learn/topics/ci-cd)

> OpenShift Pipelines is a Kubernetes-native CI/CD solution based on Tekton. It builds on Tekton to provide a CI/CD experience through tight integration with OpenShift and Red Hat developer tools. OpenShift Pipelines is designed to run each step of the CI/CD pipeline in its own container, allowing each step to scale independently to meet the demands of the pipeline.
