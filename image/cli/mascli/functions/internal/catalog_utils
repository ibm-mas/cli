# This file contains all the code that needs to change whenever a new catalog is released
# Make sure to update every function in this file when adding support for a new catalog

# This is used when determining whether a user can convert from the dynamic catalog to
# a static catalog.  We only support converting from v8-amd64 to the latest static catalog
# because any other change would be a downgrade and would result in the HEAD bundle in
# our packages regressing, which would confuse OLM.
