# IBM Maximo Application Suite Tekton Pipelines

These pipelines are all powered by the container image in this same repository, and provide an alternative to running our Ansible roles and playbooks locally.  With Pipelines you can configure your own devops processes directly in the cluster and chain togther the building blocks (ClusterTasks) that we have created.

To learn more about Tekton refer to the excellent material here: https://redhat-scholars.github.io/tekton-tutorial/tekton-tutorial/index.html

This aspect of the project is still in active development and should be considered pre-release.  However, we are using these extensively in our own development, so they should be pretty reliable given we use them multiple times every day in our automation frameworks.
