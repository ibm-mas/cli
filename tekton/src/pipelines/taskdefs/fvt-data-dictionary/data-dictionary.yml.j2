# We are running this test first since it happens to set the Suite accessTokenTimeout from the default of 30m to 12h
# This prevents subsequent test suites that take >30 mins from hitting unexpected 401s due to tokens generated by
# session-scoped fixtures expiring before the tests complete.
# This is temporary workaround, the proper fix is to make the accessTokenTimeout field configurable during install

# ADD FVT 1.1 operatormaturity ~20m
